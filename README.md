# ScribusCalendarTemplateLandscape
Scribus template for a wall calendar (A4 format (plan 2021 version, duplex 2022 version), landscape)

When I accepted to layout a calendar for some refugee support group, I could not find a nice template for Scribus open layout software in landscape format. 

The template I created might be not super elaborated, but it's a starting point if you have a similar task. 

I did the week days and ordinal series in serveral text boxes by purpose.

# PDF export to PDF x3
For print it is necessary to export the file in CMYK color schema. I had really trouble by doing this. In the window where you export to PDF you can specify the export for "printer", however then only RGB-color profiles are suggested for selection. Everything I tried came out with a bad result of realy muted colors with a kind a grey layer. 

This problem can be avoided by exporting to "PDF x3" instead of to ordinary PDF. PDF x3 is a special PDF format for printing.
